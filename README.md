# Content-Based-Image-Retrieval
Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) using Texture and Colour Moments is a technique that allows users to search and retrieve images similar to query images from
a large database based on their visual content. CBIR systems use various features extracted from images, such as colour, texture, shape, and spatial relationships, to
represent and compare images.

## Methods and Model
### 1. Colour Moments
The colour moments are a set of **statistical measures** that describe the colour distribution of an image. We calculate the first, second, and third-order moments of
the colour channels of an image (here, HSV scheme of Hue, Saturation and Value), which provide information about the **Mean, Variance, and Skewness** of the
colour distribution.

### 2. Linear Binary Patterns (LBPs)
Linear Binary Patterns (LBP) is a widely used **texture descriptor** in image processing and computer vision. LBP is a simple yet effective descriptor that encodes an imageâ€™s local texture information by comparing the pixel values of a central pixel to its surrounding neighbours
in a pre-defined, circular or rectangular region. For each pixel in the region, a binary value is assigned based on whether the intensity value is greater or less than
the intensity value of the central pixel. These binary values are then concatenated to form a binary pattern that describes the texture of the region.\

\
Binary equivalent: 00010111 and Decimal equivalent: 23. So, 23 will be the LBP value for the circled pixel. \
Similarly, for each pixel, corresponding values are calculated using which a histogram is plotted that is used as a feature vector for the image to compare it with other
images.

### 3. Similarity Measures
Similarity measures are used to compare two or more images and determine how similar or different they are.
#### Euclidean Distance
It measures the distance between the feature vector values (considered points in n-D space) of two images.
The lower value of Euclidean distance signifies that the two images are more similar or less dissimilar than the others having larger values.\

#### Cosine Similarity
It is mathematically defined as the dot product of the feature vectors divided by their magnitude. The higher cosine similarity value signifies that the two images are
more similar or less dissimilar than the others with lesser values. A negative value means that the two images are opposite vectors or not identical.\

## Results
So, overall the average precision and recall for each class were calculated using different methods are:\

## Analysis
After applying the proposed model to all ten different classes and calculating the average precision and recall by taking random query images from the dataset,
we get:\

Our model has achieved satisfactory precision by using Colour Moments and Texture features. It can be improved by taking more features into account, like shape, edges
and texture features, making the feature vector more robust to differentiate between images more precisely.
